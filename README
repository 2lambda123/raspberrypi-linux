Linux kernel
============

There are several guides made for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML or PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them are using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information reguarding
the problems which may occour while upgrading your kernel.
